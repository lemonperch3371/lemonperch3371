Hello, I am a Ph.D. Student in the Department of Quantum Matter Physics at the Université de Genève!
This repository will (hopefully) contain Python code to read Nanonis Data (Topographies, Conductance Measurements, Maps, etc.)

Additionally, I aim to integrate machine learning techniques to improve curve fitting and produce cleaner images, facilitating better data analysis and interpretation. My goal is to provide STM researchers with a built-in program for efficient data processing.
