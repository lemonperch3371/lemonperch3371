Hello, I am a Ph.D. Student in the Department of Quantum Matter Physics at the Université de Genève!
This repository will (hopefully) contain Python code to read Nanonis Data (Topographies, Conductance Measurements, Maps, etc.)

I also aim to incorporate machine learning techniques to get better curve fittings and cleaner images for analysis and interpretation. I want to make it possible for STM researchers to find an inbuilt program for processing their data.
